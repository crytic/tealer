"""Util functions to output dot files and detector results.

This modules contains functions, classes which are used to store
and display different types of output formats used by tealer detectors
and printers.

Functions:
    cfg_to_dot(bbs: List[BasicBlock], filename: Path) -> None:
        Exports dot representation of CFG represented by :bbs: in
        dot format to given filename.

    execution_path_to_dot(cfg: List[BasicBlock], path: List[BasicBlock]) -> str:
        Returns dot representation of the given control flow graph :cfg:
        with basic blocks present in :path: highlighted.

Classes:
    ExecutionPaths: Class to represent results of a detector, stores
        execution paths detected by the detector.

Types:
    SupportedOutput: Union of types used for representing detector results.
        For now, it is an alias for ExecutionPaths.
