"""Parser for teal contracts.

A TEAL contract is represented using Teal class in tealer. Teal class
comes with methods to register, run analyzers(detectors) and
printers on the parsed contract. Parsing a teal contract is
creating the Control Flow Graph(CFG) of the teal contract,
constructing Teal class instance with the CFG, subroutines and
other related information.

Additional to parsing the teal contracts, subroutines defined in
the contract are identified if there are any, versions of instructions
are verified against the contract version and also attempts to detect mode
of the contract. All the information is stored in the Teal class
representing the contract.

Contracts are parsed in four passes:

#. Parses instructions and adds sequential instruction links.
#. Adds jump based instruction links.
#. Constructs basic blocks and adds sequential basic block links.
#. Adds jump based basic block links.

The final result of parsing is the Control Flow Graph(CFG) of the
contract represented by sequence of the basic blocks.
