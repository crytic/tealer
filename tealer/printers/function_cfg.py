"""Printer for exporting subroutines in dot format.

Control Flow Graph of each subroutine defined in the contract
is exported in dot format. As the subroutines are only
supported from teal version 4, for contracts written in version
3 or less, printer doesn't do anything. Each subroutine is saved
in a new dot file with filename ``function_{subroutine_name}_cfg.dot``
in the destination directly which will be current directory if not
specified.
