    """search for execution paths lacking validations on transaction fields.

    `tealer.analyses.dataflow` calculates possible values a transaction field can have to successfully complete execution.
    Information is computed at block level. Each block's context(`BlockTransactionContext`)
    will have information on possible values for a transaction field such that
        - Execution reaches to the first instruction of block `B`
        - Execution reaches exit instruction of block `B` without failing.

    The goal of current detectors is to find if a given transaction field(s) can have a certain vulnerable value(s).
    e.g: is_updatable detector checks if the transaction can be UpdateApplication type transaction. Here, the vulnerable value for
    transaction type is "UpdateApplication". if "UpdateApplication" is a possible value then the contract is considered vulnerable and is reported.

    In order to find whether the given contract is vulnerable, it is sufficient to check the leaf blocks: whether transaction field can
    have target value and execution reaches end of a leaf block.
    However, The current output format requires "a execution path" from entry block to leaf block. And when a leaf block is vulnerable,
    it does **not** mean that all execution paths ending at that leaf block are vulnerable. It only means that atleast one path ending at
    that leaf block is vulnerable.

    For this reason, a traversal over the CFG is performed to enumerate execution paths. And for each block in the path it is checked
    whether transaction field(s) can have the target vulnerable value.

    Args:
        entry_block: entry basic block of the CFG
        checks_field: Given a block context, should return True if the target field cannot have the vulnerable value
            or else False.

            e.g: For is_updatable detector, vulnerable value is `UpdateApplication`.
            if `block_ctx.transaction_types` can have `UpdateApplication`, this method will
            return false or else returns True.
    Returns:
        Returns a list of vulnerable execution paths: none of the blocks in the path check the fields.
