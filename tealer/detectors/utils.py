    """search for execution paths lacking validations on transaction fields.

    `tealer.analyses.dataflow` calculates possible values a transaction field can have to successfully complete execution.
    Information is computed at block level. Each block's context(`BlockTransactionContext`)
    will have information on possible values for a transaction field such that
        - Execution reaches to the first instruction of block `B`
        - Execution reaches exit instruction of block `B` without failing.

    The goal of current detectors is to find if a given transaction field(s) can have a certain vulnerable value(s).
    e.g: is_updatable detector checks if the transaction can be UpdateApplication type transaction. Here, the vulnerable value for
    transaction type is "UpdateApplication". if "UpdateApplication" is a possible value then the contract is considered vulnerable and is reported.

    In order to find whether the given contract is vulnerable, it is sufficient to check the leaf blocks: whether transaction field can
    have target value and execution reaches end of a leaf block.
    However, The current output format requires "a execution path" from entry block to leaf block. And when a leaf block is vulnerable,
    it does **not** mean that all execution paths ending at that leaf block are vulnerable. It only means that atleast one path ending at
    that leaf block is vulnerable.

    For this reason, a traversal over the CFG is performed to enumerate execution paths. And for each block in the path it is checked
    whether transaction field(s) can have the target vulnerable value.

    Args:
        entry_block: entry basic block of the CFG
        checks_field: Given a block context, should return True if the target field cannot have the vulnerable value
            or else False.

            e.g: For is_updatable detector, vulnerable value is `UpdateApplication`.
            if `block_ctx.transaction_types` can have `UpdateApplication`, this method will
            return false or else returns True.
        satisfies_report_condition: Given a path, should return True if the "path" satifies the vulnerable condition.
    Returns:
        Returns a list of vulnerable execution paths: none of the blocks in the path check the fields.

                => 1. Bi, Bj, Bk, .. all end with callsub instruction.
                   2. Bi called subroutine S1. S1 contains block Bj which called subroutine S2.
                        S2 contains Bk which calls S3.

                3. current_subroutine_executed[2] contains basic blocks of S3 that were executed upto this call.

                Main purpose of this argument is to identify loops. A loop contains a back edge to a previously executed block.
                if presence of loop is checked using `return True if bb in current_path else False`, detector misses paths that
                does not contain a loop.
                Mainly, when a subroutine is called twice in a path, the second call is treated as a back edge because the subroutine's blocks
                will be present in the current path (added in the first call.)
                e.g
                    ```
                    callsub Sa  // B0
                    callsub Sa  // B1
                    int 1       // B2
                    return
                    Sa:         // B3
                        callsub Sb
                        retsub      // B4
                    Sb:         // B5
                        retsub
                    ```
                before executing B1, current_path = [B0, B3, B5, B4], bb = B1
                after executing B1, current_path = [B0, B3, B5, B4, B1], bb = B3

                B3 is already present in the current_path and so is treated as a loop even though it's not.

                In order to identify loops properly, basic blocks that are executed as part of the current subroutines are tracked.
                For above example,
                    At the start of the function
