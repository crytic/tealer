"""Defines abstract base class for detectors in tealer.

This module contains implementation of abstract class which
defines the attributes, common methods and must implement methods
of detectors. All detectors in tealer must inherit from this class
and set attributes, override abstract methods.

Attributes:
    DetectorType: DetectorType is a comparable enumerator. Detector
        type indicates what kind of contracts is that detector supposed
        to work on and find issues in them. DetectorType defines three
        symbols ``STATELESS``, ``STATEFULL``, ``STATEFULLGROUP``.

        ``STATELESS`` detectors work on and find issues in stateless
        contracts(signatures).

        ``STATEFULL`` detectors try to find issues that commonly occur
        in stateful(application) contracts.

        ``STATEFULLGROUP`` detectors work on stateful contracts that are
        supposed to verify security related checks for other transactions/
        contracts in the atomic group. One of the algorand smart contract
        development architecture is to have one contract commonly an
        application that must be included with most of the transaction
        groups interacting with the system. This contract's job is to
        verify the security properties of other transactions in the group
        along with the security properties of it's own transaction.
        ``STATEFULLGROUP`` type of detectors find issues in this kind of
        contracts, whether they are verifying/doing all the related
        security checks for other transactions in the group.

    DETECTOR_TYPE_TXT: Map from DetectorType symbol to it's string representation.

    DetectorClassification: DetectorClassification is a comparable enumerator.
        It defines ``HIGH``, ``MEDIUM``, ``LOW``, ``INFORMATIONAL`` and
        ``OPTIMIZATION``. This class is used to classify detector's impact and
        confidence.

    classification_txt: Map from DetectorClassification symbol to it's string
        representation.

    All detectors in tealer must inherit from this class and overrride
    the abstract methods with functionality specific to them. This class
    defines the api methods that must be implemented by every detector.
    ``detect`` method of each detector will be called to execute the
    detector. Every detector must implement ``detect`` method.

    Attributes:
        NAME: Name of the detector. Detector name will be used while
            displaying information about the printer and also for selecting
            the detector from command line.

        DESCRIPTION: Description of the detector about what it tries to find.

        IMPACT: Severity of the issue the detector tries to detect. IMPACT is
            classified into ``HIGH``, ``MEDIUM``, ``LOW``, ``INFORMATIONAL`` and
        ``OPTIMIZATION`` using DetectorClassification enum.

        CONFIDENCE: Precision of the detector, how often the results of this
            detector are true. Confidence is classified into ``HIGH``, ``MEDIUM``
            and ``LOW`` using DetectorClassification enum.

        WIKI_TITLE: Wiki title of the detector/issue.

        WIKI_DESCRIPTION: Wiki description of the detector.

        WIKI_EXPLOIT_SCENARIO: Example exploit scenario exploiting the issue this
            detector tries to find.
