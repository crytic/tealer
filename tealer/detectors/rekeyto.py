    TEAL, from version 2 onwards supports rekeying of accounts.
    An account can be rekeyed to a different address. Once rekeyed,
    rekeyed address has entire authority over the account. Contract
    Accounts can also be rekeyed. If RekeyTo field of the transaction
    is set to malicious actor's address, then they can control the account
    funds, assets directly bypassing the contract's restrictions.

    This detector tries to find execution paths that approve the algorand
    transaction("return 1") and doesn't check the RekeyTo transaction field.
    Additional to checking rekeying of it's own contract, detector also finds
    execution paths that doesn't check RekeyTo field of other transactions
    in the atomic group.

Rekeying is an Algorand feature which enables an account holder to give authorization of their account to different address, whereby users can maintain a single static public address while updating the key controlling the assets.
Rekeying is done by using *rekey-to* transaction which is a payment transaction with `rekey-to` parameter set to new authorized address.

if a stateless contract, approves a payment transaction without checking the `rekey-to` parameter then one can set the authorization address to the contract account and withdraw funds directly bypassing all the checks.

Attacker creates a payment transaction using the contract with `rekey-to` set to their address. After rekeying, attacker transfer's the assets using their private key bypassing the conditions defined in the contract.

Add a check in the contract code verifying that `RekeyTo` property of any transaction is set to `ZeroAddress`.
